```

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Create `.env` file:**
```env
RIOT_API_KEY=your_riot_api_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

3. **Run the server:**
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## 🚀 Usage Workflow

### Step 1: Discover Players
```bash
python mass_discover_players.py
```
- Efficiently discovers 1000+ real players
- Uses match data to maximize API efficiency
- Saves progress automatically

### Step 2: Process Players (Enhanced Analysis)
```bash
python mass_process_players.py
```
- Processes all discovered players with enhanced system
- Includes rate limiting and exponential backoff
- Resume capability if interrupted
- Generates Groq LLM descriptions

### Step 3: Use Enhanced Matchmaking
Players now have rich, natural language descriptions for semantic similarity matching.

## 📊 System Improvements

| Aspect | Old System | New Enhanced System |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| **Champion Detection** | 1 champion (recent game only) | 17+ champions (proper aggregation) |
| **Descriptions** | Template-based, repetitive | Natural Groq LLM generated |
| **Data Points** | ~10 basic metrics | 98+ comprehensive insights |
| **Analysis Method** | Single-game bias | Multi-match aggregation |
| **Embedding Quality** | Basic templates | Rich, contextual descriptions |

## 🤖 Groq LLM Output Example

For player "RareChubber#NA1":

**COMPREHENSIVE**: "RareChubber is a versatile jungle main with a penchant for aggressive play and a knack for adapting to the current meta. With a diverse champion pool and a focus on high-skill champions, they're a valuable asset to any team looking for strategic gameplay and coordinated teamplay."

**PLAYSTYLE**: "RareChubber takes an aggressive approach to the early game, often opting for champions like Draven and Rengar that excel in fast-paced, high-stakes situations."

**COMPATIBILITY**: "RareChubber works well with teammates who can support their aggressive playstyle and provide a solid foundation for their scaling champions."

**CONS**: "May benefit from more consistent performance in recent matches and could improve farming efficiency in certain matchups."

## 🔧 API Endpoints

- `POST /player` - Register player with enhanced analysis
- `POST /player/search` - Semantic similarity search using embeddings
- `GET /players` - List all registered players with descriptions
- `POST /group` - Create group with natural language matching
- `PUT /group/{id}/member` - Add player to group
- `POST /group/search` - Find compatible groups for player
- `POST /group/{id}/search` - Find compatible players for group

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### M4 Mac Optimizations
- **Embedding Generation**: ~28 embeddings/second with MPS
- **Batch Processing**: 11.7x faster than sequential
- **Search Speed**: 100 players in ~0.1 seconds
- **Analysis Rate**: ~2-3 players/minute (with rate limiting)

### Data Quality

## 🎯 How to Run Mass Processing

1. **Ensure you have discovered players:**
```bash
# Check if you have the file
ls mass_discovered_players.json
```

2. **Run mass processing:**
```bash
python mass_process_players.py
```

3. **Follow the prompts:**
- Enter max players to process (or press Enter for all)
- The script will show progress and handle rate limiting automatically
- Press Ctrl+C to stop and save progress anytime

4. **Monitor progress:**
- Progress saved every 10 players
- Real-time ETA and rate calculations
- Automatic retry on rate limits
- Resume capability if interrupted
